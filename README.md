# pseudocode2code

An algorithm which can help with translating pseudocode to code

# How the Generated Compiler Works

- takes in a 1 line input of command-style text
  - eg. "read int as N"
- splits the line of text by spaces into tokens
  - eg. ["read", "int", "as", "N"]
- treats the first element of that split as the command name
  - eg. "read"
- from the test case it saw before, it can distinguish between multiple cases of the same command; also, for each case, it knows which indices have variables and how they map to the output

# How the Compiler Code Generator Works

- reads and splits 1 line of input as mentioned above
- labels each element as a "variable" or "constant"
  - eg. ["constant", "constant", "constant", "variable"]
  - a "variable" is a token whose value is copy-and-pasted to the output
  - a "constant" is a word that is the same any time that specific command is called; it has no relation to the output and merely serves as a word to make the pseudocode more natural English and help the compiler distinguish between different use cases of the same command
- a token is recognized as a variable if one of the following is true:
  - it is composed of only capital letters
  - it is a string, float, or integer
- assumptions:
  - each variable name is not contained in another (ie "read AB A" can lead to ambiguity errors in terms of how it maps to the output)
  - no strings contain spaces (it won't ignore those spaces during the split)
  - the output does not contain substrings matching the input variables which do not correspond to the input variables
- other complicated logic

# Test Case File Format

- tuples of input output
- each input-output pair corresponds to a test case set that the compiler must handle 

# To Do

- [x] README
- [x] basic code
- [x] main.py
  - list of test cases, gen compiler and check that the input is mapped correctly to the output
- [x] try running and debug
- [x] .transform method
- [x] Simple C# Example

# Future Features

- handle missing variables by using the previous variable
- include indenting to be used for if blocks
- features based on properties of the token (ie is_pdf_path)
- do not split by spaces within a string
- test cases from the sheet of paper
- cleaning up code
  - make feature a class and have case_recog_gen_fn return a class instance?
